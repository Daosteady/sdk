# Steady USDX

**Steady USDX** is a mortgage-backed stablecoin designed to deliver sustainable yield sourced from real-world U.S. real estate debt.

## Overview

Steady USDX bridges decentralized finance (DeFi) with real-world assets (RWA) by backing its value with U.S. mortgage debt. The protocol focuses on stability, transparency, and consistent yield generation.

## Key Features

- 🏠 **Mortgage-Backed**  
  Backed by real U.S. real estate mortgage debt.

- 💵 **Stable Value**  
  Pegged to USD with asset-backed support.

- 📈 **Real Yield**  
  Yield is generated from actual mortgage interest, not inflationary token emissions.

- 🔒 **Asset-Driven Security**  
  Exposure to tangible, income-generating assets.

- 🌍 **DeFi Compatible**  
  Designed for seamless integration with DeFi protocols.

## How It Works

1. Capital is allocated to U.S. real estate mortgage debt.
2. Mortgage interest generates real-world yield.
3. Yield is distributed to USDX holders.
4. Stablecoin value remains supported by underlying assets.

## Use Cases

- Stable yield earning
- DeFi collateral
- Treasury management
- Hedge against crypto volatility

## Philosophy
